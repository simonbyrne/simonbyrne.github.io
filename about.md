Hi, I'm Simon Byrne. I'm currently a Developer Technology Engineer (DevTech) at NVIDIA, making GPUs go brrr.

Until recently, I was the lead software engineer on the [CliMA
project](https://clima.caltech.edu/), where I made stuff move around a sphere
(or sometimes around a torus).

I've been fortunate enough to work in quite a few different areas: insurance, finance,
statistics, pharmacology, and climate science, but my core interests are at the
intersection of mathematics and computation, and how each can provide insight to the
other.

I've been a long time contributor to the [Julia language](https://julialang.org/), both to the core language and many packages.
