Hi, I'm Simon Byrne. I'm the lead software engineer on the [CliMA
project](https://clima.caltech.edu/), where I make stuff move around a sphere (or sometimes
in a box).

I've been fortunate enough to work in quite a few different areas: insurance, finance,
statistics, pharmacology, and now climate science, but my core interests are at the
intersection of mathematics and computation, and how each can provide insight to the
other.

Most code I write at the moment is in [Julia](https://julialang.org/), and I've
contributed both to the core language and many packages.
